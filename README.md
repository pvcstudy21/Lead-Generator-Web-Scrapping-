This repository contains a Python script for automating the extraction of LinkedIn profile data for product managers using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. The script logs into LinkedIn, navigates to a search page, and scrapes profile links, names, titles, and locations, storing the data in a CSV file. It requires Python, ChromeDriver, and libraries like selenium, beautifulsoup4, and pandas. Simply update the ChromeDriver path in the script, log in to LinkedIn manually when prompted, and the script will handle data collection. Ensure compliance with LinkedIn's terms of service and respect user privacy while using this tool.
